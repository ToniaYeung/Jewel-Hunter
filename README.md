#### Jewel Hunter Platformer

My first game made with p5.js. 

Character moves left, right and jumps when the corresponding keys are pressed with different animations.

Scenery simulates parallax in a naturalistic way, creating a sense of perspective when the character moves to the edges of the screen.

The objective of the game is to collect all the pickable jewels in the map. On collision the jewel will disappear and a point is added to the score.

When the character walks into a moving enemy, on collision a life is lost.

When character walks into canyon, they begin to fall and a life is lost.

Game over after 3 lives are lost.
